### Using Deep Learning to Predict Water Point functionality from an Image

A Python notebook with the Keras model that we used to predict water point functionality from an image. The images we used are not publicly available but you can run the same experiments against the [Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). The image preparation code that we've used is available in this [fork of gigasquid's kagge-cats-dogs](https://github.com/pld/kaggle-cats-dogs) repository.
